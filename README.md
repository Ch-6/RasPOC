# RasPOC (Raspberry Pi POCSAG Decoder)

Features: 

Automated scanning and decoding in the background, needs very little user input, filterable results.

Requirements:

+ Raspberry Pi
+ Kali Linux
+ RTL SDR device (works with most cheapo DVB-T USB sticks!)

Usage: 

+ Install Kali Linux on Raspberry Pi
+ Run 'raspoc.sh' installer script
+ Copy 'raspoc' folder to '~/'
+ Enter desired frequency in scan.sh (if you are unsure about 'PPM' just enter '1')
+ Run scan.sh

Happy decoding.
